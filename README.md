Options Library
===============

A pure Ruby implementation of the classic Black-Scholes option model for pricing Calls or Puts.
 
Goals
-------

* Provide the Open Source Ruby, JRuby and StockTwits communities with a publicly available model for computing option prices.
* Allow users of the library to compute price and greeks: delta, gamma, theta, vega and rho.
* To aid others in the understanding of how price and sensitivities to other factors are computed on a theoretical basis.
* To allo users of the library to extend or contribute back to the project so that it may be improved upon.


Installation
-----------

    gem install options_library


Usage
-----

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'options_library'

    call = OptionLib::Call.new
    call.underlying = 95.40  # spot price of the underlying
    call.strike = 90.00  # strike price of option
    call.time = 0.015 # time in years
    call.interest = 0.01 # equates to 1% risk free interest
    call.sigma = 0.4875  # equates to 48.75% volatility
    call.dividend = 0.0  # no annual dividend yield
   
    price = call.calc_price # theoretical value of the option
    delta = call.calc_delta # option price sensitivity to a change in underlying price
    gamma = call.calc_gamma # option delta sensitivity to a change in underlying price
    vega  = call.calc_vega  # option price sensitivity to a change in sigma (volatility)
    
    implied_vol = call.calc_implied_vol( 1.80 ) # implied volatility based on the target price 

    # Or go straight at the Calculator methods
    # Option::Calculator.price_call( underlying, strike, time, interest, sigma, dividend )
    call_price = OptionLib::Calculator.price_call( 94.5, 90.5, 0.015, 0.01, 0.4875, 0.0 ) 

Testing
-------
